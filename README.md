This is the code for my project of making a 'simulation' of split bill using C++. In this code, these features are used:
- STRUCT to represent each person and each individual item.
- VECTOR to create a dynamic array that we can manipulate easily.
- LOOPS (for-loop and while-loop) to deal with user's input and answer.
- MATH OPERATIONS to calculate the fee per person + tax rate.
